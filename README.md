Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

* Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

* i). The development of programming languages (e.g, Fotran, C)
* ii). The establishment of Software Engineering as a discipline in 1960s.
* iii). The advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

* Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
* Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
* Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
* Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
* Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
* Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

* The waterfall methodology follows a structured, sequential approach where each phase (requirements, design, development, testing) is completed before moving to the next. It is rigid, requires extensive documentation, and works best for projects with clear, stable requirements such as government, banking and aerospace projects.
  
* The agile is an iterative, flexible approach that involves continuous development, testing and customer feedback. It allows teams to adapt to changing requirements and deliver working software in small increments. Agile is best suited for projects with evolving needs, such as startups, mobile apps and customer-facing apps.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

* Software developer - Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
* Quality Assurance Engineer - Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
* Project Manager - oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.
* System architect - designs the overall structure and architecture of software systems.
* UI / UX designer - creates user interfaces and designs user experiences for software applications.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

* An IDE is a software suite that provides developera with tools to write, test and debug code efficiently. It integrates features like a code editor, compiler, debugger and automation tools, enhancing productivity. e.g Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Pycharm, Eclipse.
* Version Control Systems is a system that tracks and manages changes to code over time. It allows multiple developers to collaborate without losing previous versions of the code. e.g (Git, subversion, mercurial)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

* Changing requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
* Tight deadlines: pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
* Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

* Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

* i). Unit testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
* ii). Integration testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
* iii). System testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
* iv). Acceptance testing: testing the software against iser requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

* Prompt engineering is the process of debugging and refining inputs (prompts) to guide AI models, like ChatGPT, copilot, to generate more accurate, relevant and useful responses.
* Importance: Enhances response quality - well crafted prompts lead to clearer, more precise and relevant AI generated answers.
Maximize AI efficiency - A well structured prompt reduces unnecessary iterations, saving time and computing resources.
Reduces ambiguity - Clear prompts help minimize vague or misleading AI responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

* Vague prompt - "Tell me about Technology."
* Improved prompt - " Explain how AI is transforming the healthcare industry, with examples of it's applications.
The improved prompt is more effective:
* More specific - Instead of broadly asking about technology, it focuses on AI within healthcare.
* Clear scope - specifies what aspect of AI to discuss.
* Actionable request - Clearly asks for examples, ensuring a detailed and informative response.
